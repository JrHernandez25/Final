#1 The project will be worked on time given during class, but it will also be worked on during any free moment that I am given in order to put my best work on the application.

#2 The project is another web game that will take place in a jungle survival setting that will have choices that the player can pick but will also be under a time limit.

#3 The web game will function with buttons that will take you to a new page that will first be introduced with a cutscene made with animations. The the player will be told the story of that page and will have to choose one of the four options given. Each option will have a different impact on the game, but the player will also have to keep in mind that each section is timed and if the player doesn't pick in time the game will choose something for you instead.

#4 The code that I will be using for the building of this web game is Javascript, Index, and lastly CSS. The Javascript will contain all the functionality for the web game, while the Index will contain the wirting and everything not functionality based. The CSS is the important part for me as it will contain the animation stying for the mini cutscenes.

#5 The task that I will complete are well all of them because this project will be worked on by one person and that me, but I will be focusing more on the Javascript and Styling of the web game as those will be the most time consuming parts.

#6 I will be completing the tasks above by using any free time I have to work on the project when ever I can but will also use class time wisely in order to turn in a web game that will be appealing to anyone.
